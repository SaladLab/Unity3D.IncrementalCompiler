# Unity3D.IncrementalCompiler

Unity3D Incremental C# Compiler using [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).
- You can get faster compilation speed. Because it works as an
  [incremental compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_compiler)
- You can use C# 5 and 6 features.

This project is at an early development stage.
And still now it can support only windows platform.

### Setup

Unzip [a release zip file](https://github.com/SaladbowlCreative/Unity3D.IncrementalCompiler/releases)
to your unity project top-most directory.
(Unblocking zip file before decompressing zip file might be required to
avoid TypeLoadException of Unity-Mono.)

- When Unity 4.x, use IncrementalCompiler.Unity4.zip
- When Unity 5.x, use IncrementalCompiler.Unity5.zip

A release zip has a plugin dll which should be put at Editor folder and
a few compiler related files which should be put at Compiler folder.
Following before and after screenshot will helps for understanding install location.

While an incremental compiler build your scripts, it saves log files to project/Temp
directory. With these log files, you can see how it works.

### Configuration

You can configure how this compiler work by settings window.
Click "Assets/Open C# Compiler Settings..."  in UnityEditor.

Not only settings but you can also check detailed log and information.

![SettingsWindow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaladbowlCreative/Unity3D.IncrementalCompiler/master/docs/SettingsWindow.png)

Also you can manually modify a configure file which is located at project/Compiler/[IncrementalCompiler.xml](https://github.com/SaladbowlCreative/Unity3D.IncrementalCompiler/blob/master/core/IncrementalCompiler/IncrementalCompiler.xml)

### More information

- [Under the hood](./docs/UnderTheHood.md)

### Faq

- When incremental compiler is installed, Unity claims something wrong like:
```
TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'UnityEditor.Modules.CSharpCompiler' from assembly 'UnityEditor, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'.
UnityEditor.Scripting.ScriptCompilers.CreateCompilerInstance (MonoIsland island, Boolean buildingForEditor, BuildTarget targetPlatform, Boolean runUpdater) (at C:/buildslave/unity/build/Editor/Mono/Scripting/ScriptCompilers.cs:93)
```
  This problem is usually caused by windows file blocking system.
  You need to unblock zip file before uncompressing this file.
